The code for the hourly graphs, prints the vertical concentration of SO_4 int the Atmosphere (location near Thrakomakedones, Attiki, Greece). 

For each hour, a new figure in a seperate window is created.


The spatial graphs, create the spatial distribution of SO_4 in the atmosphere, at the arear of Attiki's basin.

With pcolor, interpolation between colours of different intensities (wich correspond to different pollutant concentrations) is achieved.
